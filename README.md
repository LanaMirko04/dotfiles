# Dotfiles (Hyprland + Arch)

Personal dotfiles for my Arch Linux setup, built around [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland).

## Quick Install
Just run:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LanaMirko04/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/setup.sh)"
```

## Requirements
- Arch Linux (or an Arch-based distro).
- `curl` and `git` must be installed.

## Notes
- This is an **incomplete personal setup**.
- The script assume a minimal base-system installed.
